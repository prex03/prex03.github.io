Hello, World! 🌍

I’m Prerak Singh, a second-year undergraduate at IIT Delhi, studying Electrical Engineering. This blog is where I plan to document my journey through programming, systems, and all things software.

I’ll be using this space to share what I’m learning, write about the software projects I’m working on, and reflect on interesting problems I encounter along the way. Some posts might dive into technical implementations, others might focus on debugging challenges, and some will be raw notes on topics I’m still exploring.

Think of this as a digital lab notebook. It might get messy at times, but I hope it remains honest and useful.

Thanks for stopping by, and feel free to stick around as I build, break, and learn. 🙂
