ðŸ‘‹ Hello, and welcome! I'm Prerak Singh, an undergraduate student pursuing a B.Tech in Electrical Engineering at IIT Delhi, currently in my second year. With a CGPA of 9.15 and a consistent academic track record, Iâ€™ve always found myself drawn to the intersection of mathematics, logic, and technology. This natural alignment has evolved into a deep interest in programming, systems research, and applied machine learning.

This blog is my attempt to build a living archive of everything I explore in the world of software. It is a space where I reflect on concepts, experiment with ideas, and document the thought process behind what I build. I believe that understanding the reasons behind how a system works is just as important as knowing how to implement it. Through this platform, I aim to grow not just as a programmer, but as a thinker and engineer.

I have a strong foundation in core technical subjects such as data structures, algorithms, digital electronics, and signals and systems. My academic journey has been shaped by both formal education and a persistent desire to learn beyond the classroom. I take particular interest in the theory and practice of programming languages, software reliability, and the design of intelligent systems.

Academically, I have been fortunate to receive recognition for my efforts. I ranked among the top students in my department and was awarded a Merit Scholarship for academic excellence at IIT Delhi. Before joining college, I secured an All India Rank of 582 in the JEE Advanced, competing among over 200,000 candidates. I also qualified in national-level Olympiads in science and mathematics, which gave me early exposure to problem-solving at a high level and fostered my curiosity and analytical thinking.

In essence, this blog serves as a personal lab notebook where I chart my learning journey across different domains in computing and engineering. Whether you are here out of curiosity or a shared interest, I hope you find something valuable or thought-provoking in what I share.
